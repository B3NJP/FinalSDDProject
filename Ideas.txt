IDEAS:
Only STR and INT based damage, no DEX damage (this is because DEX is used for attack amounts, not damage)
Anti-defence skills for DEX users decrease enemy defence

DEX and AGI are directly compared and difference is added to 50

If damage is 0, characters are not launched?

Weapons alter stats like in Disgaea, not damage calculation
Cancelling maybe? Have certain 'Arts' only cancellable by certain other 'Arts'.

Mid combat combo creation

Arts window


Single character for now, then expand
Enemy no combo, then expand
