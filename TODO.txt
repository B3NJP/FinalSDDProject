1. Make proper display function (File done, make other UI files) - also make a way to provide information to the player - a reference sheet can be used temporarily?
2. Fix the direction for loc to use sine and cosine instead of the mess of ifs
3. Alter hit chance formula to favour hitting when difference is small
    Perhaps make it so greater agility gives increasing returns rather than flat returns. Then set the base chance much higher.
    Add criticals?
4. Fix up basic characters
5. Make AI (No need for enemies to act in the same way as the player)
6. Compress the inputs and events into a new file
