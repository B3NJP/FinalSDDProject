  <h2>Combos and Arts</h2>
  <p>
    Combos and arts are the primary (and only way for the player) to attack in this game. A combo is a collection of arts that trigger them in sequence. Arts are the basic building blocks of combos and are used as basic attacks.<br><br>
    An art has a few primary features:
    <ul>
      <li>Arts have a modifier that affects how it will interact with an enemy. These include increasing physical attack to lowering the enemy's defence.</li>
      <li>Arts will move the enemies around.</li>
      <li>Arts will move the player around.</li>
      <li>Arts may hit multiple spaces.</li>
    </ul>
    For instance, the basic art Pierce:<br>
    Attacks the one space in front, and moves the player and enemy one forwards.<br><br>
    The basic art Broad Slash:<br>
    Attacks three spaces in front and moves enemies to the right, but without moving the player<br>
  </p>
  <h2>Enemies</h2>
  <p>
    At the start of each level, 5 enemies will spawn.
